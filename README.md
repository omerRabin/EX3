# EX3
Hello, you have arrived at Eldad and Omar's project on the subject of weighted directed graphs written in Python.\
In our project we built software that produces deliberate weighted graphs and allows you to make changes to them and even various algorithms.\
In addition during the project we made comparisons between the runtimes of the functions in our algorithm class to the algorithm Class of the network-X to\
the algorithm class of our preivious Project in Java. \
The main algorithm we used in this project is DFS. we used this algorithm to find the shortest path from two nodes in the graph.\
In addition, we used DFS to find a SCC of node and all the SCC's in the graph. SCC is the strongest connected component. \
Our project consists of several classes that create the graphic system:\
The main classes is: DiGraph, GraphAlgo.\
